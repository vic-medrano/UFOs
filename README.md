# UFOs
## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to help Dana further customize her webpage by allowing potential users to filter through mutliple criteria at the same time. Users will be able to filter through data not only by date but also by location (city, state, and/or country), as well as shape of the sighting.

## Results
Users will be able to type in search criteria using the box shown up above. They do not need to fill in all the boxes to obtain an answer. Once a user types in an answer and presses enter, the results will automatically begin to filter. As seen in the image below, they will obtain a table-like structure of information in return.

The image above shows a user what the information on the page will look like prior to a filter. 
Users will be able to filter by several categories. For instance, if we were to filter entries from the state of California, we would type "ca" into the state box and press Enter.The image below shows the result of a search response for "ca".

We can further narrow down the search in California to only obtain results in California in which the shape of the UFO was reported as a triangle by typing "triangle" into the shape filter box. Adding an additional filter to the California filter will obtain results as shown below.

From the image we can see that we filtered using two different specifications. We can continue to narrow down search resutls by modifying the boxes and adding more information for the computer to sift through. Finally, we want to see only results for triangle shaped UFOs in El Cajon, California. We enter the city into the appropriate box as seen in the image below and are given two final instances of UFO sightings with this criteria.

## Summary
- Possible Drawback: One drawback of this design is that the states and countries are all abbreviated in the datasheet that the information will be filtered from. If a user attempts to type the full name of the state or country (ex: "California" instead of "ca") then then the filter will not return any information for that item. 
- Solutions: This could be fixed in the future by adding all variations of the state and country to the datasheet or by telling the user to enter the abbreviated form before typing. Or this could even be solved by providing dropdown boxes with known information based off the datasheet to allow users to only filter with the options available and not have to worry about case sensitivity.
